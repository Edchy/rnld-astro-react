## TODO

- View transition
- Real-time input validation
- Save deleted workout to history (undo delete)
- Add avatar (cloudinary)
- HTTP: only
- Weight units and conversion
- Save workouts to local storage for more efficient loading (don't need to fetch from server)
- Store tokens and workouts in the user object in ls - not as separate items (problems logging in two users)
